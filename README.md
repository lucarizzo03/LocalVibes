# MusicSwipe
MusicSwipe is a music discovery platform inspired by Tinderâ€™s swipe mechanic. Users swipe through songs or artists, liking what they enjoy. For GitHub, it could be a fun way to discover music-related projects, repositories, or tools by swiping through them, starring or forking what interests them.
